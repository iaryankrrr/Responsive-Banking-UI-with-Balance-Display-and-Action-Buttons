# Responsive-Banking-UI-with-Balance-Display-and-Action-Buttons
This project is a simple and responsive banking interface built using only HTML and CSS. It includes a balance display area and two buttons: Deposit and Withdraw. The layout is clean, centered on the page, and looks good on all screen sizes â€” from desktop to mobile.
